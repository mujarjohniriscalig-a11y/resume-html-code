    <h2>Professional Summary:</h2>
    <p>
        A professional creative writer who is currently working as an Escalation Manager with a remarkable 1 year and 4 months experience as a Customer Service role at one of the largest telecommunications company in Canada, which is Bell. But to be honest, aside from being a writer. I dreamed of becoming one of the best programmers in the world.
        To be honest, I just wanted to explore and learn new skills not only for the betterment of myself, 
        but also to shift into the tech industry.
